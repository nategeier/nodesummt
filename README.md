###Nate Geier Bio
Nate started Interactive Balance in 2009 by building a custom LMS, written in Flash and PHP, launching successfully, deploying to over 2,000 Hotels. Two years later its parent company wanted it for all 17 major brands worldwide. Faced with mobile issues, in early 2012, Node version 0.6, Interactive Balance made a gamble on the future of Node and rewrote everything using ExpressJS. The gamble is paying off in spades.

###My trials and tribulations of rewriting an enteprise Flash/PHP LMS from scratch and under a deadline
***
It may sound terrifying and it is, but if you know by now the benefits of Node and have a team frothing at the mouth to get going on it then just rewrite it, all of it. 
The hard part is the decision in wiping two or five or even ten years worth of lost sleep, coffee bindges and endless debugging, but once you get past that and do your fresh app creation with Express or whatever framework your team goes with, it all gets easier and more exciting from there.
