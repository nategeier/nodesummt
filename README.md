###Nate Geier Bio
Nate started Interactive Balance in 2009 building custom LMS's in Flash and PHP, launching successfully to over 2,000 hotels. Two years later its parent company wanted the LMS for all 17 major brands worldwide. In early 2012, faced with mobile issues, Interactive Balance made a gamble on the future of Node 0.6 and rewrote everything using ExpressJS. The gamble is paying off in spades in every aspect from the client side to server.

###Trials and tribulations of rewriting to Node from scratch and under deadlines
***
It may sound terrifying, and it is, but if you know by now the benefits of Node and have a team frothing at the mouth to get going on it then just rewrite it, all of it. 
The hard part is the decision in wiping two or even ten years worth of lost sleep, coffee bindges and endless debugging. However, once you get past the nostalgia and do your fresh app creation with Express or whatever framework your team goes with, it all gets easier and more exciting from there.
